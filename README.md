# Simple_Voice_Translator
This is a simple voice translator made using Google APIs. It takes the audio input from user through the laptop's microphone and displays the translated result in text form and also stores the translated audio. 

It supports any language available in the Google translation dictionary. Also, in case it doesn't recognise the language you are asking for, it will ask you to speak clearly again. The python package - Tkinter - has been used to create a GUI to display the translation after taking the inputs. The texts are displayed in their respective spoken and required translated languages. In the end, it stores the translation as an audio file.

Package installations required are: pyaudio; SpeechRecognition; pyttsx3; pypiwin32; googletrans; gTTS
